=Disclaimer before use!=

-The bat will NOT save any information like your Username or Password
-Once started it will close Steam so DON'T use it while In game!
-After typing in your username you can close the bat if you just want to use it without creating a permanent changer.

=Basic information about the changer.
It bypass the need for Steam Guard Code and Auto Logins into your steam account
It's a pretty simple bat that adds “AutoLoginUser” and “RemeberPassword” into the steam registry. It will put your username as in the AutoLoginUser.
And remember password is just set to 1 so it knows that the password is saved

=How to use=

- Start the AccountChanger.bat

- Type in your steam Username

- A login screen will appear , login there

- Once that's done you can now switch to that account using the accountchanger.bat

 OR 

- If asked to make a permanent bat type Y 

- A bat file will be created bounded to the username you just used.

- Now whenever you want to switch accounts just use the Permanent changer or the Account Changer
